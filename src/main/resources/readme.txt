# Specifications: GitHub Activity Feed

Write and deploy a web application that uses the GitHub Events API to display a given user’s recent activity.
At minimum, it should be able to list the most recent public actions taken by a given user,
but beyond that you are free to be as creative (or minimalistic) as you wish.
Submit links to the source code repository (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, …)
as well as to the deployed application (AWS and Heroku’s free tiers are good choices for this).

At heart, we’re looking to see that you write clean, maintainable, extensible code.
The details of that are up to you, but we encourage you to consider issues like testing,
packaging and deployment, and error handling in your submission.
